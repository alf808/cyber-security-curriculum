# Computer Lab Documentation

## 1. Pre-Requisits:
Read Chapter 2 in the A+ book

## 2. Safety Procedures Before Beginning 

- Electrostatic Discharge (ESD):
When opening up a PC it is important to prevent the passage of a static electrical charge from one item to another. While this isn't very dangerous to humans (besides a small shock maybe) it is deadly to sensitive computer parts
Before touching anything on the computer you want to ground yourself to the computing device. This can be done by using an Anti-static wrist strap and have an anti-static mat underneath the computer. 

- Stay Organized:
It is very easy to lose small pieces when disasembling and assembling a computer. It can also be easy to get wrapped up in wires/cables which can be very dangerous.

- Accesories:
Remove any jewlery or loose hanging lcothing that could get caught in a fan or stuck in the computer. This is a real thing and has actually happened to me!
