# Computer Lab Documentation

## 1. Prerequisits:
Read Chapter 2 in the A+ book
Suggested reading chapters 4,5,6,7 and skim chapter 8

## 2. Safety Procedures Before Beginning Lab

- Ground Yourself 
When opening up a PC it is important to prevent the passage of a static electrical charge from one item to another. While this isn't usually very dangerous to humans (besides a small shock maybe) it can be deadly to sensitive computer parts. Before touching anything on the computer you want to ground yourself to the computing device. This can be done by using an Anti-static wrist strap and have an anti-static mat underneath the computer. 

- Stay Organized:
It is very easy to lose small pieces when disassembling and assembling a computer. It can also be easy to get wrapped up in wires/cables which can be very dangerous.

- Accessories:
Remove any jewelry or loose hanging cothing that could get caught in a fan or stuck in the computer. This is a real thing and has actually happened to me!

-Be Prepared: 
Make sure you have all the neccesary tools needed before jumping in.

## 4. Troubleshooting
Activity- Each team will take their working computer system and make approx 5 tweaks which will stop the computer from working. Each tweak will need to be documented in case your forget and need to change it back. Then the teams will switch computers and attempt to identify, troubleshoot and fix the "issues" with the system to get the machine back functioning correctly. They will need to document their fixes as well so they compare it to the original teams documentation. Then discuss common troubleshooting issues and how you solve it.

Examples of tweaks-
1. Computer wont turn on (Monitor is unplugged or has a bad cable)
1. Computer is frozen (Mouse or keyboard is unplugged)
1. Monitor works but tower wont turn on (Power supply may be turned off)
1. Post beep codes and what do they mean?
1. Hardware not properly installed
1. Memory Failures (error message such as "parity error xxxx.xxxxxxxxxx)
1. Heat, dust, etc.
1. System lockup
1. Bad RAM (May trigger NMI)
1. Blue screen of death (Check CPU)
1. OS errors, buggy programming, bad settings
