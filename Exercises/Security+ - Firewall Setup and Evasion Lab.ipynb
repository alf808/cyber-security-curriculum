    "   * A firewall is considered a **protective** control as oppoed to a **detective** control like an IDS\n",
    "   * A firewall is generally hardware or software that filters what traffic is allowed into a network or a network interface\n",
    "   * A properly configured firewall should block ALL traffic by default and whitelist what kind of traffic is allowed explicitly\n",

    "#### Nmap firewall evasion techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Decoys (-D) - Mask the source of scan, makes it hard to block\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT --top-ports 10 -D 10.0.2.6 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        * `nmap -sS -D Rnd:5 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Ping suppression (-Pn)\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT -Pn 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "\n",
    "    * TCP ACK Scan/Half-open scan (-sA) - Send only replies, useful for stateless firewall and IDS that are setup to allow replies to SYN requests\n",
    "        * `nmap -sA 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * TCP Window Scan (-sW) - Very similar to the ACK scan with a little difference, the TCP window scan has been designed to differentiate between open and closed ports instead of showing unfiltered\n",
    "        * `nmap -sW 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Fragmentation (-f) - Break the header down into smaller fragmented packets, pieces are reassembled at the destination. \n",
    "        * `nmap -sT -f 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT -ff 10.0.2.8` (further break down headers)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Changing data length (--data-length n) Can also get around signatures w/ larger than normal packets. Adds data length to end of packet. `-mtu` packets must be in multiples of 8\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT --data-length 120 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT -mtu 8 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        * `nmap -sT -mtu 24 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Mac Address Spoofing (--spoof-mac) - Used to hide the actual source of traffic or to spoof as another host on the same network\n",
    "        * `nmap --spoof-mac Cisco 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Timing Delay (--scan_delay 5ms) - Used to slow down requests to not set off alarms\n",
    "        * `nmap -sS --scan_delay 5s 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Bad checksums (--badsum) - Improperly configured IDS or firewalls \n",
    "        * `nmap -sS --badsum 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Random host order (--randomize-hosts) - Used to not set off a firewall, best used with timing delay\n",
    "        * `nmap --randomize-hosts 10.0.2.6-100`\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Idle scan (-sI) - only works with servers that respond with linear fragment id's. Used to completely mask the true target of the scan, but never receive the actual response. Cannot decipher between closed and filtered ports with this scan method. \n",
    "        * `nmap -sI 10.0.2.7 10.0.2.8`\n",
    "        * https://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Using multiple combinations to avoid detection\n",
    "        * `nmap -sS -T1 -f --badsum --data-length 1200 --proxies sock4://176.57.216.214:80,http://213.85.92.10:80 44.35.33.21`\n",
