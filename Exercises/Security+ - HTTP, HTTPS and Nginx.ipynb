    "    \n",
    "#### Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open VirtualBox\n",
    "\n",
    "* Under Settings, select the Network tab for the following Virtual Machines:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Kali\n",
    "    * Ubuntu 18.04\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select the `Bridged Adapter` option in the `Attached to:` drop down menu\n",
    "\n",
    "* Click the Advanced option\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select the `Allow All` option in the `Promiscuous Mode:` drop down menu \n",
    "\n",
    "![title](img/virtualbox-bridge-network-setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start Kali3 virtual machine \n",
    "\n",
    "* Start Ubuntu virtual machine\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open a terminal and take note of your current assigned IP address for each machine using: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Linux(Kali/Ubuntu): `ifconfig` or `ip addr`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux (Kali and Ubuntu)**\n",
    "![Linux Ip Config](img/kali-ifconfig.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start Wireshark on your **HOST** operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* On the start screen select your wireless interface of your **HOST** operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the `...using this filter:` box under the `Capture` section enter the following filter to only capture traffic from our Kali virtual machine\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enter the following value: `tcp port 80`\n",
    "\n",
    "![HTTP Filter](img/http-wireshark-filter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hit Enter or click on the `Start capturing packets` button' to start your capture session\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the Apply a display filter box, further filter your view to include `http`, this will show you only HTTP request/responses and not other misc. TCP requests\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open your web browser and visit `http://www.stealmylogin.com/`\n",
    "\n",
    "* You should start to see HTTP reply/response pairs show up in your packet capture window\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wireshark stealmylogin capture](img/wireshark-stealmylogin-capture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** Notice how a single request has multiple request/responses come back. These are all files required by that single web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you right-click on the first packet and select the Follow->HTTP Stream option, you will see all requests/responses in a single view in plain text which will contain an HTML response along with HTTP request and response headers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wireshark Folllow HTTP Stream](img/wireshark-view-http-stream.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wireshark Folllow HTTP Stream Results](img/wireshark-http-stream-results.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stop your capture and start a new capture (decide if you want to save your capture or not) and use the following filter: `tcp port http or tcp port https`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next go to http://google.com\n",
    "\n",
    "    * You will be redirected to `https://google.com` which uses SSL encryption and makes it much harder to filter on traffic for a specific site because the HTTP headers are encrypted as well, neither Wireshark or an attacker can see them \n",
    "    \n",
    "* There are several filters you can use to see traffic more clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * All HTTP Traffic (won't show HTTPS trafic): `http`\n",
    "    * Filter by domain (with name resolution enabled): `http.host == \"www.stealmylogin.com\"`\n",
    "    * Filter by HTTPS: `ssl`\n",
    "    * Filter by HTTP and HTTPS: `http or ssl`\n",
    "    * Filter by domain names (contains): `http.host contains \".com\"`\n",
    "    * Filter by domain names (explicit): `http.host == www.stealmylogin.com`\n",
    "    * Filter by extension (contains): `http.request.uri contains \".html\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next we're going to go into our **KALI GUEST** virtual machine and run the following scan against the IP address of our **UBUNTU GUEST** to scan for open ports\n",
    "\n",
    "* Run the following command, replacing with the IP address for **YOUR** Ubuntu guest machine to scan for services on **ALL** ports: `nmap -sV -p- 192.168.0.70`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ubuntu Port Scan](img/ubuntu-port-scan-closed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* On your **UBUNTU GUEST** run the following commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "sudo apt-get install nginx\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ubuntu Nginx Install](img/ubuntu-nginx-install.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once the installation finishes check that the Nginx service is running with the following command: `sudo systemctl status nginx`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nginx Status](img/nginx-status.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Now that Nginx is running, go back to your **KALI GUEST** and try your Nmap scan again\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nginx Nmap Scan](img/nginx-nmap-scan.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can see that Nginx now opened a port and is listening on that port for traffic. What happens if you now browse to that IP and port on your Kali machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nginx Landing Page](img/nginx-landing-page.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, create a file in that directory called `wut.html` with the contents:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <h1>Wut is this magic?!?!?!</h1>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Now browse to `http://localhost/wut.html`\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, we'll browse to the Nginx configuration directory in the standard Linux configuration `/etc` directory with: `cd /etc/nginx`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nginx Configuration](img/nginx-configuration-steps.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Go over Nginx configuration and defaults\n",
    "TODO: Capture in Wireshark\n",
    "TODO: Create an insecure form in HTML to POST back to the same page and capture in Wireshark\n",
    "TODO: Enable port 443 with no SSL and show it's a standard port\n",
    "TODO: Change to enable SSL on port 443\n",
