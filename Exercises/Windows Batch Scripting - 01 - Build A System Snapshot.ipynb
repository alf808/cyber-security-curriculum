    "\n",
    "To Whom It May Concern,\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to take a current inventory snapshot of our current systems and some standard user and network information for all of the machines on our network. This will help in comparing consistenty across the organization as well as creating a standard baseline security configuration for our infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need you to create a script that we can use to run on other machines on the network to collect necessary information and provide some standard configuration for Windows machines specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure your script covers all requirements as specified by our beloved CISO.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Requirements\n",
    "1. Your script should be able to be callable via the command line interface\n",
    "1. Your script should take a **single optional parameter** as input which will prefix all stdout lines with the given prefix. If this parameter is not passed as a command line argument you should set a reasonable default value that will be used instead\n",
    "1. Your script should exit upon completion\n",
    "1. Your script should have meaningful comments throughout for other people to understand what it is doing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Information\n",
    "We need to collect some standard information about our users and the basic configurations of the machine. \n",
