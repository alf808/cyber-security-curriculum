    "# JavaScript and Browser Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of understanding how web applications work is key to application security and vulnerability assessments. There isn't a book big enough to teach you all the ways in which a modern web application could be compromised. Understanding the basics of how applications work, the tools to assist you, and creative thinking when figuring out how to \"break things\" are the keys to success.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Understand the desired behavior and then try to achieve unintended behaviors from there. **\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTTP Requests\n",
    "  - Remember that web applications are 99.9% HTTP traffic\n",
    "  - Remember that HTTP is a stateless protocol\n",

    "### How is JavaScript executed in the browser\n",
    "  - JavaScript files referenced by the HTML via `<script>` tags are executed as soon as they're downloaded\n",
    "  - Any embedded JavaScript code within the HTML document with an opening and closing `<script></script>` tag pair is executed as soon as it is encountered in the HTML\n",
    "  \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<script src=\"/js/main.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" />\n",
    "<script src=\"https://someotherdomain.com/js/somelibrary.js\" type=\"text/javascript\" />\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "    alert('hello hacker');\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Things to know about modern applications\n",
    "  - AJAX/XHR (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)\n",
    "      - Used to make roundtrip calls to servers without page reloads, often undetected\n",

    "      - Storage -> Session Storage\n",
    "          - Similar to localStorage but expires when the browser closed (not the tab)\n",
