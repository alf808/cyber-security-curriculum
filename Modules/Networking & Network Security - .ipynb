    "# Hardware Security \n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: Chapter 16 (WAN's) we are not going to cover\n",
    "\n",
    "To find any corporate networks that are not connected to the Internet is rare, which makes sense because we need to be connected to the Internet to do the majority of our day to day tasks\n",
    "- Connecting our private networks to a huge public one, can expose you to some security risks\n",
    "- To succeed in protecting our networks from intrusion, theft, exploitation and espionage we need to make smart networking decisions\n",
    "- We need things like firewalls, IDS's and IPS's\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Hardware and Software Security devices\n",
    "- For large enterprise networks, strategies for security usually include some combination of internal and perimeter routers plus firewall devices.\n",
    "- Internal routers provide added security by screening traffic to the more vulnerable parts of a corporate network \n",
    "- pg. 501 \n",
    "\n",
    "DMZ\n",
    "- Demiliterized Zone\n",
    "- A network segment that isnt public or local but halfway between the two\n",
    "- This is typically where you will find the HTTP, DNS Service, email and other Internet-type corporate servers\n",
    "- People outside your network primarily access your web servers, FTP servers etc. and because thats what hackers usually target, its a good idea to place them behind the DMZ\n",
    "- Can be global (real) Internet addresses or private addresses, depending on how you configure your firewall\n",
    "- Used to create a security zone that allows public traffic but the traffic is isolated from the company's private network\n",
    "    - A standard DMZ typically has 3 Network cards in the firewall computer\n",
    "    - The first goes to the Internet\n",
    "    - Second goes to the Network Segment (this is where commonly targeted servers exsist)\n",
    "    - Third connects to your intranet\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Firewalls\n",
    "- Firewalls are usually a combination of hardware and software\n",
    "- the hardware part is usually a router but it could also be a computer or dedicated piece of hardware called a black box that has 2 NIC's in it\n",
    "- One of the NIC's would be connected to the public side and the other one connects to the private side\n",
    "- The software part is configured to control how the firewall actually works to protect your network by scrutinizing each incoming and outgoing packet and rejecting any suspicious ones\n",
    "- Firewalls generally allow only packets to pass specific security restrictions to get through\n",
    "- They can permit, deny, encrypt, decrypt and proxy all traffic that flows through\n",
    "- Whoever sets up the firewall decides on and sets up the rules a firewall follows when deciding to forward data packets or reject them\n",
    "    - Network Based Firewalls\n",
    "        - what companies use to protect their private network from public networks\n",
    "        - The defining characteristic is that its designed to protect an entire network of computers instead of just one system\n",
    "        - This can be quite the challenge and usually requires a combination of hardware and software\n",
    "        - This is however the overall goal\n",
    "    - Host based Firewalls\n",
    "        - implemented on a single machine so it only protects that one machine\n",
    "        - Usually software based, because you don't need any additional hardware in your personal computer to run it\n",
    "        - Windows comes with Windows Firewall  (example)\n",
    "- Firewall technologies\n",
    "    - Access control lists and dynamic packet filtering can be implemented along with proxies and DMZ's and other firewall technologies to build a serious formidable system\n",
    "    - Capable of preforming scanning services, which means that they scan different types of incoming traffic in an effort to detect problems\n",
    "    - They can scan incoming HTTP traffic to look for viruses or spyware, or scan email to look for spam\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Default rules on Cisco routers\n",
    "    - MAIL      SMTP          Scans all scannable files in the email\n",
    "    - MAIL      SMTP          Rejects all messages larger than 15mb\n",
    "    - MAIL      SMTP          Rejects all messages addressed to more than 100 recipients\n",
    "    - MAIL      SMTP          Cleans email attachments containing malware\n",
    "    - WEB       HTTP          Scans all files downloaded\n",
    "    - WEB       HTTP          Scans webmail sites like aol, google and yahoo\n",
    "    - WEB       FTP           Scans all file transfers\n",
    "    - WEB       FTP/HTTP      Skips scanning of files larger than 50MB\n",
    "    - WEB       FTP/HTTP      Cleans files in which malware is detected \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Give you a pretty good level of coverage\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Dynamic Packet Filtering\n",
    "    - the ability of a router or firewall to discard packets that dont meet the right criteria\n",
    "    - firewalls use dynamic packet filtering to ensure that the packets they forward match sessions initiated on their private side by something called a dynamic state list, which keeps track of all communication sessions between stations from inside and outside the firewall\n",
    "     - This list changes dynamically as sessions are added and deleted\n",
    "     - firewall looks at an incoming packet and applies it against the set of rules in the ACL and if it passes it gets sent on, if not the packet is dropped\n",
    "     - Only packets for valid and current sessions are allowed to pass\n",
    "     - Ex: say a computer in Network A requests a telnet session with a server in Network B, the firewall in between the two keeps a log of the communication packets sent each way and only packets that belong to the current session will be allowed back into Network A through the firewall\n",
    "        - pg. 508 -509 \n",
    "\n",
    "Content Filtering\n",
    "- Blocking data based on the content of the data rather than the source of the data\n",
    "- Most commonly used in mail and web traffic\n",
    "- What are some examples? Where would we use this?\n",
    "    - Categories\n",
    "        - Attachments (.exe)\n",
    "        - Email headers\n",
    "        - Language\n",
    "        - Phrases\n",
    "        - Proximity of words to each other\n",
    "        - URL's\n",
    "        \n",
    "Signature identification\n",
    "- Firewalls can also stop attacks and problems by signatures\n",
    "- So viruses or software bugs such as worms or spyware that are have a known signature (a particular pattern of data within them) can be tracked and removed\n",
    "- If your router starts getting hit by a large number of SYN requests you may be at the beginning of a SYN flood attack. The inundation of SYN traffic is a signature of a SYN flood attack\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxy Servers\n",
    "- Proxies act on behalf of the whole network to completely separate packets from internal and external hosts\n",
    "- Firewalls can implement proxy services which make them proxy servers\n",
    "\n",
    "- IP Proxy\n",
    "    - hides the IP addresses of all devices on the internal network by exchanging its IP address for the address of any requesting station\n",
    "    - This is good because you don't want a hacker to know any IP addresses specific too your internal network\n",
    "    - Even Internet web servers wont be able to determine the specific IP address from which they receive a request, because any communications appear to have originated from the proxy server- Awesome!\n",
    "- Web Proxy\n",
    "    - handle HTTP requests on behalf of the sending workstation\n",
    "    - When implemented correctly, a client's web browser asks a web server on the Internet for a web page using an HTTP request\n",
    "\n",
    "ACL's (Access Control List) \n",
    "- First line of defense for any network that is connected to the Internet is an ACL\n",
    "- These reside on your routers and determined by IP addresses, which machines are allowed to use those routers and in what direction\n",
    "    - ACL's have been around for decades and have some really cool uses apart from firewalls\n",
    "         - Ex: Two networks with an ACL- enabled router in the middle, Network A can access Network B, B cannot access A, B can Access A if a secure, authenticated connection is detected\n",
    "         - However data from users in Network A can still pass through the router into Network B\n",
    "         - This means a hacker executing an IP spoofing attack that makes it appear as though their IP address originating from inside the firewall can still gain access to Network B by pretending to be a valid user on Network A\n",
    " - Are essentially lists of conditions that categorize packets\n",
    " - Used for filtering unwanted packets when your implementing security policies\n",
    " - You can set up ACL's to make very specific decisions about regulating traffic patterns so that they'll allow only certain hosts to access web resources on the Internet while restricting others\n",
    " \n",
    "  - Security Threats that ACL's can help Mitigate\n",
    "      - IP address spoofing, inbound & outbound\n",
    "      - DOS TCP SYN Attacks\n",
    "      - DoS Smurf Attacks\n",
    "      - Filtering ICMP messages inbound\n",
    "      - Filtering ICMP messages outbound\n",
    "      - Filtering traceroute\n",
    "       \n",
    "      - You can also use ACL's to control which networks will or wont be advertised by dynamic routing protocols by applying them to a routing protocol instead of an interface\n",
    "      - You can use ACL's to categorize packets for queuing or quality of service type services for controlling the types of traffic that can activate a pricey backup link\n",
    "     \n",
    "- Creating an ACL\n",
    "    - Its a lot like programming a series of if-then statements \n",
    "    - If a given condition is met, then specific action happens\n",
    "    - But if that explicit condition isnt met, nothing happens except that the next statement in the list is evaluated\n",
    "    - Access-list statements are basically packet filters that packets are compared against, categorized by, and then acted on accordingly as directed\n",
    "    - Once your list is built, it can be applied to either inbound or outbound traffic on any interface causing the router to analyze every packet crossing that interface \n",
    "\n",
    "- Types of ACL's\n",
    "    - Standard ACL's\n",
    "        - Use only the source IP address in an IP packet as the condition test, so all decisions regarding a packet will be based on the source IP address\n",
    "        - This means that standard ACl's basically permit or deny an entire suite of protocols without distinguishing between the type of IP traffic like web, telnet, UDP etc.\n",
    "    - Extended ACL's\n",
    "        - evaluate lots of other fields in the layer 3 and 4 headers of an IP packet\n",
    "        - They can evaluate source and destination IP addresses, the protocol field in the network layer header, the port number in the transport layer header\n",
    "        - Once you create and ACL it kind of just sits on the router inactive until you tell the router what to do with it\n",
    "        - You need to apply the ACL's to the right interface and to the right direction of traffic\n",
    "        - You probably want different controls for inbound traffic and outbound traffic\n",
    "    - Inbound ACL's\n",
    "        - Packets are processed through the ACL before being routed to the outbound interface\n",
    "        - Any packets that are denied wont be routed because they get discarded before the routing process is complete\n",
    "    - Outbound ACL's\n",
    "        - ACL's applied to outbound packets on an interface are routed to the outbound interface and then processed through the ACL before being queued\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Need to be applied to the interface or they wont filter any traffic\n",
    "    \n",
    "    RULES\n",
    "    1. Deny any addresses from your internal networks\n",
    "    2. Deny any local host addresses 127.0.0.0/8\n",
    "    3. Deny any reserved private addresses\n",
    "    4. Deny any addresses in the IP multicast range (224.0.0.0/4)\n",
    "    These addresses should never be allowed to enter your internetwork\n",
    "     \n",
    "        \n",
    "      EX: As network administrator, you must have remote access to your router. This access should not be available to other users of the network. Therefore, you will configure and apply an access control list (ACL) that allows PC access to the Telnet lines, but denies all other source IP addresses.\n",
    "      \n",
    "         \n",
    "Intrusion detection and Prevention systems\n",
    "- If someone has broken into your network how would you know? You wouldnt find a broken window right?\n",
    "- As we talked about above, firewalls are designed to be that first line of defense and block traffic, but what if something or someone gets through\n",
    "- IDS\n",
    "    - An IDS can detect attacks or intrusions\n",
    "    - Looks for fingerprints of strange or abusive things going on in the network\n",
    "    - Looks for anomalies in network activity\n",
    "    - Learns on the go and keeps track events to use to compare against in future unusual activity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Network Based IDS\n",
    "        - A separate  device attached to the network via a switch\n",
    "        - Some can attach to the network both outside and inside the firewall\n",
    "        - pg. 519\n",
    "        - When an IDS detects an intrusion it can respond either passively or actively\n",
    "        - All activity is logged\n",
    "        - Notifications are sent as alerts\n",
    "        - Shunning- you can choose to ignore certain types of attacks (an attack that wont affect your network)\n",
    "    - How\n",
    "        - An attack comes in on port 21, your IDS can close the port either temporarily or permanently\n",
    "        - Could close down port 80 for like 60 seconds\n",
    "        - It could terminate all sessions to close and restart (could delay traffic)\n",
    "        - It could also deceive attacker \n",
    "            - Tricks the attacker into thinking their attack is really working when its not\n",
    "            - Uses a honeypot which directs the attacker to a group of servers or even access points\n",
    "            - Its intended to keep their interest long enough to gather enough information to identify the attacker, their attack method, what they are attacking and logs it so you can prevent it in the future\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Host based IDS\n",
    "        - Software that runs on one computer to detect abnormalities on that system alone by monitoring applications, system logs and event logs\n",
    "        - Typically implemented on servers\n",
    "       \n",
    "Physical Security\n",
    "- A note here is that we can do everything possible to protect our network and implement and expensive, robust security setup using firewalls and IDS's but if we also dont physically protect our devices its all for naught\n",
    "\n",
    "- HCC Story of theft\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principles\n",
    "    - Implicit deny\n",
    "        - if a user isnt mentioned in the .allow file they are implicitly denied\n",
    "        - grant few people access than manage long lists\n",
    "    - least-priviledged mode\n",
    "        - users only get bare minimum of resources they need access to\n",
    "        - access level is always lowest possible\n",
    "    - Separation\n",
    "        - separating administrative duties allows you to know which admin's have access to specific parts of the network\n",
    "    - Rotate\n",
    "        - Cross train people in various jobs\n",
    "        - Make sure you have more than 1 person who has access or understands how each system works so they dont have all the control and if something were to happen to them your not screwed\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Access Control Models\n",
    "    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC)\n",
    "        - everyones role regarding the network and related information access is set in stone\n",
    "        - Users cant share information unless they are explicitly allowed to \n",
    "        - Strictest and least flexible\n",
    "        - Gives admin a lot of control\n",
    "        - Military \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Discretionary Access Control (DAC)\n",
    "        - Users have a say about who can access what data\n",
    "        - Opposite of a MAC and can result in a wide open system\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Role-Based Access Control\n",
    "        - Access to resources is based on role of the individual within the company\n",
    "        - users get access based on who they are and what they do\n",
    "    - Rule-based Access Control\n",
    "        - Predefined security policies based on specific rules are used to determine network access\n",
    "        - assumes users with the same roles may actually have different needs\n",
