    "Wireless Networks\n",
    "- Wireless started out as a way of sending audio programs through the air we called it ______ (radio)\n",
    "- Then it was used to transmit pictures we called it _________ (Television)\n",
    "- Use the same frequency to both transmit and receive (half-duplex)\n",
    "    - Everyone is sharing the same same bandwidth and only 1 user is communicating at a time\n",
    "- Wireless LANs (WLANs) use radio frequencies (RFs) that are radiated into the air from an antenna that creates radio waves.\n",
    "    - However these waves can be absorbed, refracted, or reflected by walls, water, and metal surfaces, resulting in low signal strength. \n",
    "    - Because of this innate vulnerability to surrounding environmental factors, \n",
    "    - Wireless will struggle to offer us the same robustness as a wired network can\n",
    "They do offer:\n",
    "    - Mobility\n",
    "    - Installation speed and simplicity\n",
    "    - Felxibility - they can allow access to places \n",
    "    - Cost\n",
    "    - Security (recently)\n",
    "    - Convienence \n",
    "    - Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "- WLAN’s transmit over radio frequencies,regulated by the same types of laws used to govern things like AM/FM radios \n",
    "- The FCC regulates the use of LAN devices and the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) creates the standards based on what frequencies the FCC releases for public use\n",
    "\n",
    "802.11\n",
    "- 802.11 specifications were developed so that there would be no licensing required in most countries\n",
    "- To ensure the user the freedom to install and operate without any licensing or operating fees. \n",
    "- This means that any manufacturer can create wireless networking products and sell them at a local computer store or wherever. \n",
    "- It also means that all our computers should be able to communicate wirelessly without configuring much, if anything at all. \n",
    "- The specification requires a data transfer rate of from 1 Mbps up to 2 Mbps while\n",
    "- The specification requires a data transfer rate of 1Mbps - 2Mpbs while retaining compatability with exsisting LAN hardware and software infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FCC released 3 unlicensed bands for public use: 900MHz, 2.4GHz and 5GHz\n",
    "- 900 & 2.4 bands are referred to as the industrial, scientific, and medical bands (ISM)\n",
    "    - 802.11b, 802.11g and bluetooth devices such as cordless phones, garage door openers, and some light bulbs, microwave ovens\n",
    "- 5GHz known as the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII) band\n",
    "    - Higher data rates 54Mbits/second\n",
    "    - 802.11a which is faster and more flexible than 802.11b\n",
    "    - Can suffer more with LOS (line of sight) obstructions like walls, desks and people\n",
    "    - If you want to deploy wireless outside 3 public bands, you need to get a specific license from FCC\n",
    "- 5GHz (802.11a)\n",
    "    - Products didnt begin appearing on the market until late 2001\n",
    "    - Maximum data rate of 54Mbps with 12 non-overlapping frequency channels\n",
    "    - Immune to interferences from devices like microwave ovens, bluetooth, etc\n",
    "    - Not backwards compatible with 802.11b becuase they are different frequencies\n",
    "    - Data rate shift\n",
    "- 5GHz (802.11h)\n",
    "    - FCC added 11 new channels in 2004\n",
    "    - Now we gain access to 23 non-overlapping channels\n",
    "    - Two new features Dynamic Frequency Selection and Transmit Power Control\n",
    "    - DFS & TPC (pg. 385)\n",
    "- 2.4GHz/5GHz (802.11n)\n",
    "    - Adds Multiple-Input Multiple Output which employs multiple transmitters and receiver antennas to increase data throughput\n",
    "    - Up to 8 but most use 4\n",
    "    - Allows for much higher data rates\n",
    "    - If you see a sticker on a device that says Wi-Fi = Wireless Fidelity and indicates the product in question has passes certification testing for 802.11 interoperability by the Wi-Fi Alliance\n",
    "- 2.4GHz (802.11b)\n",
    "    - Most widely deployed wireless standard\n",
    "    - Maximum data rate of 11Mbps\n",
    "    - Big brother 802.11g so why go buy an 802.11b card or access point\n",
    "    - The problem with 802.11b is how the data link layer is dealt with, in order to solve problems in the RF spectrum, a type of ethernet collision detection was created called Carrier sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)\n",
    "    - CSMA/CA is Like TCP 3 way handshake, called a request to send, clear to send because of the way that hosts must communicate to the access point\n",
    "    - For every packet sent, an RTS/CTS and acknowledgment must be recieved \n",
    "    -Backwards compatible meaning it delivers 54Mpbs data rates (802.11a) but runs in the 2.4GHz range (802.11b)\n",
    "    - Easy to migrate to and is affordable to 802.11b wireless infrastructures\n",
    "        - Ex: 4 users running 802.11g cards and 1 user starts using 802.11b cards, everyone connected to the same access point is then forced to run 802.11b CSMA/CA method\n",
    "- You can disable the 802.11b-only modes on access points\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Wireless networks are less complex than wired networks because you really only need an access point and a wireless NIC\n",
    "\n",
    "Access point\n",
    "- Connects wireless devices together and allows them to communicate with each other\n",
    "- A device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. \n",
    "- An access point connects to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a Wi-Fi signal to a designated area. \n",
    "    - EX: For example, if you want to enable Wi-Fi access in your company's reception area but don’t have a router within range, you can install an access point near the front desk and run an Ethernet cable through the ceiling back to the server room.\n",
    "- Have at least 1 antenna and a port to connect them to a wired network\n",
    "- There are the standalone AP’s and also ones that include a built-in router which you can use to connect both wired and wireless clients to the internet\n",
    "    - Called a wireless router\n",
    "- They’re usually employed as NAT servers by using one ISP provided global IP address to multiplex numerous local IP addresses that are generally doled out to inside clients by the wireless router from a pool within the 192.168.x.x range\n",
    "- In this scenario you dont have to make any changes with the ISP to increase number of devices\n",
    "\n",
    "- The router acts as a hub that sets up a local area network and manages all of the devices and communication in it. An access point, on the other hand, is a sub-device within the local area network that provides another location for devices to connect from and enables more devices to be on the network.\n",
    "- Wireless routers can function as access points, but not all access points can work as routers. While routers manage local area networks, communicate with outside network systems, acquire, distribute, and dispatch data in multiple directions, establish a point of connectivity, and ensure security, access points typically only provide access to the router’s established network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NIC\n",
    "- Every host that wants to connect to a wireless network needs a NIC\n",
    "- Has a radio antenna which is used via microwave radiation \n",
    "- You might use an external nic to increase your signal in an area of poor reception\n",
    "- What layer of the OSi model (1 & 2)\n",
    "- Traditionally connected using PCI bus\n",
    "- An 802.11 Wireless NIC can operate in two modes known as infrastructure mode and ad hoc mode\n",
    "     - Ad hoc Is a continuously self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected wirelessly\n",
    "- Many newer mobile computers have a wireless network interface built into the motherboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireless Antenna\n",
    "- Act as both transmitters and receivers\n",
    "- Omni directional (point-to-multipoint) and directional or yagi (point-to-point)\n",
    "- Yagi’s provide greater range  focus all their power in a single direction whereas Omni antennas must disperse the same amount of power in all directions at the same time\n",
    "- Very precise when aligning\n",
    "- Most AP’s use Omni’s because often clients and other AP’s could be located in any direction\n",
    "- OMNI- Your car can be parked in any direction and still get same signal reception\n",
    "- Yagi- Television antenna that you had to dial \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireless Security\n",
    "- The original 802.11 comittee just didnt imagine that wireless hosts would one day outnumber bounded media hosts\n",
    "- war driving- driving around with a laptop a wireless nic and a high-gain antenna trying to locate open AP's \n",
    "- In a secured wireless connection, internet data is sent in the form of encrypted packets. These packets are encrypted with network security keys. If you somehow manage to get hold of the key for a particular wireless network you virtually have access to the wireless internet connection.\n",
    "- Open access mode - security features are turned off\n",
    "    - Why?\n",
    "- SSID's \n",
    "    - open shared-key authentication, static WEP (wired Equivalent Privacy) and optional MAC authentication\n",
    "    - An SSID prevents access by any client device that does not have the SSID\n",
    "    - However by default an access point broadcasts its SSID \n",
    "    - Even if the SSID broadcast is off, a bad person could monitor the network and discover a client connecting to an access point\n",
    "    - Why? Because that information is regulated by the original 802.11 speciffications and must be transmitted in clear text\n",
    "- Shared Key Authentication\n",
    "    - the access point sends the client device a challenge-text packet that the client must then encrypt with the correct WEP key and return to access point\n",
    "    - All an intruder has to do is detect both the clear text challenge and the same challenge encrypted with a WEP key and decipher the WEP Key\n",
    "    - This is not really used anymore in todays WLAN's\n",
    "- MAC Addresses\n",
    "    - MAC addresses can be manually configured in the AP of the hosts and denied access in the filter table\n",
    "    - All mac layer information is sent in the clear so anyone equipped with a wireless sniffer can just read the packets sent to the access point and then spoof their MAC Address\n",
    "- WPA and WPA 2 Pre-Shared Key\n",
    "    - another form of security that is added on\n",
    "    - Wi-Fi protected Access is a standard developed by the Wi-Fi alliance\n",
    "    - the PSK verifies users via a password or identifying code (passphrase) on both the client machine and access point\n",
    "    - A client can only gain access if its password matches the access points password\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "https://www.wired.com/story/wikileaks-cia-router-hack/\n",
    "Netsh\n",
    "- Netsh is a very powerful command line tool that lets you change almost any network configuration setting as well as document network configurations\n",
    "     - netsh wlan show drivers\n",
    "         - netsh wlan show profiles name=\"Dev League 5GHz\" key=clear\n",
    "     - The Interface Dump subcommand saves your current network configuration and generates a script that you can use to regenerate the configuration. The command\n",
    "        - netsh interface dump > mycfg.dat\n",
    "     - The Netsh Exec command runs a Netsh script file. The command\n",
    "        - netsh exec mycfg.dat\n",
    "            - restores to your system the network configuration data that the preceding sample command saved.\n",
    "     - Netsh works with DHCP, Internet Authentication Service (IAS), and RAS interfaces as well as the local network interface. The command\n",
    "          - netsh dhcp dump > dhcpcfg.dat\n",
    "              - dumps the local DHCP server's configuration to the dhcpcfg.dat file. You can use this file in conjunction with Netsh to recreate the DHCP server.\n",
