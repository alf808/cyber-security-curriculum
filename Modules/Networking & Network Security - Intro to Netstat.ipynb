    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "- TCP/IP knowledge\n",
    "- Basics of Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Topics/Sub-Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is netstat?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why netstat?\n",
    "Netstat is installed on most Linux and Windows distributions by default. Netstat is good at showing connections open on your machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### netcat Basics\n",
    "Netcat essentially does **two things** very well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transfer Data\n",
    "2. Listen for Requests on a Port\n",
    "\n",
    "** Flags **\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-l` - Listen on port\n",
    "- `-v` - Verbose output, good habit to use on most use cases since default feedback is minimal\n",
    "- `-p` - Port to listen on\n",
    "- `-e` - Execute command on connection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What can netcat do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used in scripts to automate tasks\n",
    "- Copy a file between two systems with not FTP or SSH:\n",
    "- Clone a hard drive or partition:\n",
    "- Port scan\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Copy Files Between Servers\n",
    "    - Server: `nc -lp 1234 > some-file.tar.gz`\n",
    "    - Client: `nc -w 1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 1234 < some-file.tar.gz`\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Clone Hard Drive or Partition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Port Scanning\n",
    "- Check for a single port: `nc -v 192.168.1.24 80`\n",
    "    - What kind of connection is this?\n",
    "- Check remote server for a range of ports: `nc -v -w 1 192.168.1.24 -z 1-1000`\n",
    "- Check local server for open ports: `nc -v -w 1 localhost -z 1-1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Execute Shell on Established Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Act as a web server\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spoof HTTP Headers/Request Web Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Act As Chat Server\n",

    "##### Auto-closing SSH tunnel\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Challenges/Exercises\n",
    "- Setup a backdoor on a system and use Nmap to discover\n",
    "- Install fail2ban and scan that host and see how you can configure to get even stealthier requests to jail\n",
    "- Look at firewall logs for the scans you are creating and see what makes it's way to the logs and what doesn't\n",
