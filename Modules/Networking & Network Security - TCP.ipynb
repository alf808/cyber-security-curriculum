    "# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### History \n",
    "Very first Request For Comment (RFC) published in 1969 which paved the way for todays internet and its protocols.\n",
    "https://www.ietf.org/rfc.html\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP/IP first started in 1973, in 1978 it was divided into TCP and IP then back to TCP/IP in 1983\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### \n",
    "TCP/IP Model (condensed version of the OSI Model)\n",
    "1. Process/Application Layer -> (Application, Presentation, Session)\n",
    "2. Host-to-host Layer        -> (Transport)\n",
    "3. Internet Layer            -> (Network)\n",
    "4. Network Access Layer      -> (Data Link, Physical)\n",
    "\n",
    "Process/Application Layer\n",
    "- Defines protocols for node-to-node application communication\n",
    "- Controls user-interface specifications\n",
    "- Telnet, FTP, TFTP, SMTP\n",
    "\n",
    "Host to host layer \n",
    "- Parallels the functions if the OSI's Transport layer, defining protocols for setting up the level of transmission service for applications\n",
    "- Tackles issues of creating reliable end-to-end communication\n",
    "- Packet Sequencing and maintains data integrity\n",
    "- TCP /  UDP\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet Layer\n",
    "- Protocols related to logical transmission of packets over the entire network\n",
    "- Takes care of addressing of hosts by giving them IP addresses \n",
    "- Routing of Packets\n",
    "- ICMP, ARP, IP\n",
    "\n",
    "Network Access Layer\n",
    "- Monitors the date exchange between host and network\n",
    "- oversees hardware addressing and defines protocols for the physical transmission of date\n",
    "- Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Token Ring \n",
    "\n",
    "### TCP- Transmission Control Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes large blocks of information from an application and breaks them into segments. \n",
    "- Numbers and sequences each segment so that the destinations TCP process can put the segments back into the order the application intended\n",
    "- After they are sent, waits for an acknowledgment from recieving ends TCP process\n",
    "- reliable, full-duplex, connection-oriented, accurate, error checking \n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP segments a data stream and prepares it for the Internet Layer, Internet Layer recieves the data stream and routes the segments as packets through an internetwork, Handed to the recieving hosts Host-to-Host layer protocol, which rebuilds the date stream to hand to upper layer prtocols\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a session called:\n",
    "\n",
    "Three Way Handshake \n",
    "Connection Oriented\n",
    "During the initial handshake, the two TCP processes also agree on the amount of information that will be sent in either direction before recipient sends back an acknowledgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for TCP SYN packet\n",
    "Conversation Filter TCP - Shows just the packets involved in connection\n",
    "Stream Index- Wireshark assign each TCP connection a stream index starting at 0 -> however many connections in file (Could just filter on this stream using index number)\n",
    "Sequence Number- 4 byte value in reality that is confusing (Hey mr. server this is the sequence number I am begining with so track everything from now on)\n",
    "Flags- Syn is the only bit set (SYN true)\n",
    "Windows size- Size of TCP bytes able to recieve \n",
    "Options- Maximum Segment Size thats the amount of bytes you can put in a tcp segment (Could be changed by a router or something)\n",
    "Len - Nothing being sent from a data persepective\n",
    "\n",
    "SYN ACK Packet\n",
    "- ack set\n",
    "- both agree 1460 for amount of bytes\n",
    "- TCP Sack is permitted\n",
    "\n",
    "ACK From Client\n",
    "- Same sequence numebr means everything is working\n",
    "- only 1 bit set for ack\n",
    "- We would not know that the true windows scaling is 17520 to know true window\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to start sending data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TCP Header \n",
    "- 20 bytes long\n",
    "\n",
    "With everything agreed in advance, the path is paved for reliable communication \n",
    "\n",
    "While the information is being transfered between hosts, the two machines periodically checkin with each other, to make sure everything is going well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three way Handshake\n",
    "SYN First connection agreement is a request for synchronization\n",
    "SYN-ACK Acknowledge the request and establish connection ruless between hosts\n",
    "ACK Final Segment is Acknowledgment and notifies destination host that the connection agreement has been accepted \n",
    "\n",

    "Congestion can occur\n",
    "bottlenecking\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow Control\n",
    "- Data integrity is ensured at the transport layer by maintaining flow control\n",
    "- Provides a means for the receiver to govern the amount of data sent by the sender\n",
    "- Prevents a sending host on one side of the connection from overflowing the buffers to the receiving host.\n",
    "- The segments delivered are acknowledged back tot he sender upon reception\n",
    "- Any segments not acknowledged are retransmitted\n",
    "- Manageable data flow is maintained in order to prevent congestion, overloading and data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If too many packets are sent or they are sent too quickly, the computer stores them in the memory section called buffer. If it keeps flooding the device it will eventually start dropping packets and discarding the additional datagrmas that arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network flood control systems actually work pretty well \n",
    "The transport can issue a not ready indicator to the sender or source of the flood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A service is considered connection-oriented if:\n",
    "1. Uses a three-way handshake\n",
    "2. Uses Sequencing\n",
    "3. Uses Acknowledgements\n",
    "4. Uses flow control\n"
