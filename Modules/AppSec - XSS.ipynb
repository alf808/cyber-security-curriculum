    "### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n",
    "- More than 30% of sites are still vulernable to this especially if they are old.\n",
    "- Uses Embeded javascript thats embeded in the html to execute a script.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oeLbpP4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of XSS\n",
    "- Stored XSS: Adding something to a database.\n",
    "- Reflection XSS: A temp response from a server that can trick to run a script.\n",
    "- DOM based XSS: Could be a query param being rendered to DOM without any filtering.\n",
    "- Blind XSS(some recognize this): Example, have an internall app that pulls in data from outside source. Can trick this app to evaluting something and take advantage from there.\n",

    "### Locations to look for XSS\n",

    "\n",
    "### XSS Demo:\n",
    "- Tool used BEEF: XSS framework that can be found on Kali.\n",
    "  #### Installation/Start BEEF\n",
    "    - ```apt-get install beef-xss```\n",
    "    - Start: ```sudo beef-xss``` must be ran as root user.\n",
    "    - Login: username: beef password: beef. This will log you into the UI that is launched from start.\n",
    "    - Hook.js is the file that will be served.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### MITMF(Man in middle framework)\n",
    "  - Make sure to have substantial space allocated to VM image. Use ```apt-get clean``` to clear out installs usage.\n",
    "  - installation instructions : https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/MITMf/wiki/Installation\n",
    "  - Do ```find -name virtualenvwrapper.sh``` if not located in same place as instructions. If true, move all other associated files to /usr/bin before creating the virtualenv. From there, rest of install instructions should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XSS Prevention Quiz\n",
    "- Plugins should have easy reporting / procedures in place to report issues/vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- Check to see if they list XSS attacks that they cover and browser requirements.\n",
    "- Look carefully at permissions when get a new plugin. Should be looking at the code. \n",
    "- Always incognito mode. Don't allow extensions incognito mode.\n",
    "- Browser plugins can XSS if have full accesss. \n",
    "- Limit what web applications can do. Ex. limit what can be returned from your database.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ZziEN2f.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge 1: XSS1\n",
    "- run ```npm start``` on repo. This will create a DB for you under DB directory. Go to localhost:3000.\n",
    "- Use test email and passwords. Dont use sensative even though running on localhost.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MXxNuLx.png)  \n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "1. When creating a new account in input field can try injecting some html. Try enter ```Tyler's<b>Checking</b>```. This will make the word checking appear bold. This shows that you are able to inject code directly into DOM.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uLULvZ6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/GuLHlts.png)\n",
    "  - This allows an alert to be sent to the user. This is a stored and reflected attack. If you inspect the success message, this is a transient piece of data. Try also injecting same into url.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Data\n",
    "- Never trust raw user data.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8PoC6bi.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sanitizing User Data\n",
    "- Most view frameworks have pretty good protection from XSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/66RVORG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BZ55zRl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/olixEvH.png)\n",
    "  - Pull in data from external source, keep user values as values not code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content Security Policy(CSP)\n",
    "- Example, can only run scripts from certain origin. Anything else, browser will not render script.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/lRru79S.png)\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/2hOvnyO.png)\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fF8f8iX.png)\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ajwClDs.png)\n",
    "- Add checksum to CSP or nonce. If using nonse, CSP needs to line up also.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aJSv7MZ.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge 2: Defend against XSS Attacks\n",
    "- Helmetjs adds CSP headers to requests to express apps. Read docs and include into server/index.js\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Q2bfohM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### Challenge 2: Solution\n",
    "  1. Search for all occurances of <%- in the code base. Fix all instances and replace with <%=. Now refesh application page and should now see all script injections treated like html. If you inspect these in dev tools, script tags will be black not blue showing being treated as text.\n",
    " ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/IZ7Yvzr.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "  2. https://github.com/helmetjs/csp. Require package in and add following code to server/index.js. Refresh the page and will see a bunch of errors. Start at top and fix errors by implementing CSP in image above.\n",
    "      - Look at request headers in network tab to see the CSP thats implemented. \n",
    "      - These fixes don't allow arbitrary data entered into text fields and also adds CSP to lock down where / how things are loaded to site.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Malicious Attachments\n",
    "- Attachments can embed things in it like a PDF with a trojan embeded within it.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/7tymaYS.png)\n",
    "- Find squirrel.jpg and replace it with .html. Open in browser and now have html that you can inject scripts into. Example, your app lets users upload images and figures out they can rename the file, they can now inuject scripts in the html.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge 3: XSS Attachment\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/SHD0h9t.png)\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/CegR1cv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### Challenge 3: Solution\n",
    "  - Will be using tool to read the html of the image and replace it with our own.\n",
    "  - run ```node ./scripts/exif.js read ./examples/squirrel.jpg| pbcopy```. This reads of the image that the browser is rendering.\n",
    "  - Create a new file scratch.html on root level and paste contents of first command ran into the file. Make sure to keep everything on one line.\n",
    "  - Run ```node ./scripts/exif.js write ./examples/squirrel.jpg scratch.html```. This will read whatever we put in the scratch.html file and write it to the squirrel.html. Change h1 tag in scratch.html to whatever you want. Will see updated info changed after running command.\n",
    "  - Change file extension of squirrel.jpg with .html and open in browser. Will see the changes that you made.\n",
    "  - Shows you can inject code into an image.\n",
