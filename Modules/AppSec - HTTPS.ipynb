    "#### HTTPS\n",
    "- LetsEncrypt around 2016 lets everyone get these certs for free so everyone can add HTTPS.\n",

    "#### HTTPS & Cryptography\n",
    "- Public key cryptography has both a secret key and public key. The public key is used to create encrypted messages and private key is used to read the messages.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/jGYiRg7.png)\n",
    "- The server will make its public key + certificate available to anyone that wants to use it just for sending messages that can only be read by the server.\n",
    "- Cipher suites are the methodology used for that faster symmetrical encryption later on.\n",
    "- Session keys are one time use  generated by the client. If MITM was happening, couldn't read the data since only server has key to decrypt the clients session key.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3rfx6Az.png)\n",
    "- Easy to encrypt one way and impossbile to go the other way. One way encryption\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/wtQDnUH.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TLS Handshake\n",
    "- Client verifies server certificate using trusted roots that are built in OS or browser. Example, apple root certificate, komoto root cert. So if you use one of the certs, you trust any domain that is signed by these certs.\n",
    "- Public and private keys you generate are just for the key exchange. Everything in between is done with symmetric encryption cause much faster\n",

    "\n",
    "##### OPENSSL\n",
    "- Leave encyrption to experts, and use the library.\n",
    "- Best we have so far and command line driven.\n",
    "- Always create short lived certs so have to be reneiwed all the time.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/cKWVXYS.png)\n",
    "- OpenSSL commands.\n",

    "#### Challenge 1: Defend against MITM\n",
    "- Will be working in index.js on root level.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ghycxsW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenge Solution\n",
    "- Working in index.js on root level, remove http module and replace with https module.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/po5kHTX.png)\n",
    "- Comment out ```var server = http.createServer(app);``` and add following https code.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Generate New Private Key\n",
    "  - Enter the commands in your terminal to gen. new ssl cert.\n",
    "  - Dont store private keys in un-encrypted form. You want locked with password symmetrically encrypted. Anytime you want to use this key, you must enter the password.\n",
    "  - This will create a new file in your project.\n",
    "  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tzqQmVx.png)\n",
    "  - Update server code adding in path to key and store passphrase in an environment variable.\n",
    "  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MKTJxqB.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Generate New Public Key\n",
    "  - Enter commands to generate new public key. You will have to verify with your private key password.\n",
    "  - Anyone can use the public key.\n",
    "  - This will create a new file in your project.\n",
    "  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pi8l1L2.png)\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Make new Cert Signing Request\n",
    "  - You will have to enter some information. Dont include a challenge password.\n",
    "  - This will also create a new file in your project\n",
    "  - ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bmKbzTR.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sign New Cert with Private Key\n",
    "  - This will generate the new cert that has been signed with your private key. This will add new file to your project.\n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/1mm8ZIO.png)\n",
    "  - Update cert key;\n",

    "#### Need to fix server error when start, something to do with the cert or put back to http"
