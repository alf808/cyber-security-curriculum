    "# Python Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "Tabs vs Spaces. All that ever really matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments/Self Documenting Code\n",
    "    - Block comments (`#`)\n",
    "        - Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and are indented to the same level as that code\n",
    "        - Block comments are good for detailing how something works that may not be obvious to your future self or someone else\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Inline comments \n",
    "        - General rule, don't use them unless they add value\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Documentation(doc) strings (`\"\"\"`)\n",
    "        - Doc strings can be thought of more what is this code for vs how does this code work(block comment) \n",
    "        - Doc strings should be used to document high level code to:\n",
    "            - Describe the purpose/usage of a module\n",
    "            - Describe the purpose/usage of a class\n",
    "            - Describe the purpose/usage of a function and it's parameters and return values\n",
    "            \n",
    "    \"\"\"Train a model to classify Foos and Bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Usage::\n",
    "\n",
    "        >>> import klassify\n",
    "        >>> data = [(\"green\", \"foo\"), (\"orange\", \"bar\")]\n",
    "        >>> classifier = klassify.train(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "    :param train_data: A list of tuples of the form ``(color, label)``.\n",
    "    :rtype: A :class:`Classifier <Classifier>`\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables, functions, methods, packages, module: `lower_case_with_underscores`\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Exceptions: `CapWords`\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected methods and internal functions: `_single_leading_underscore(self, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Methods: `__double_leading_underscore(self, ...)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### README/Documentation\n",
    "Always, always have clear instructions on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What the project does\n",
    "2. How to install the project and any dependencies\n",
    "3. How to run the project including any configuration details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "Functions should follow a few simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functions should do only 1 thing and do it well. Validate input, handle exceptions, have appropriate logging...\n",
    "2. Keep it simple\n",
    "3. Functions should have no more than 3 parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "Once code bases start becoming large code gets very hard to change or reason about. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should start thinking about how to organize your code into high level related groups of functionality as early as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** All functions that deal with reading/writing from files should be separated from functions that deal with reading/writing to a database or making http calls\n",
    "\n",
    "`from filesystem import writefile`\n",
    "`from mysqlutilities import purge_database`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "Put all imports at the top of your file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git commits and .gitignore\n",
    "https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n",
    "2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n",
    "3. Capitalize the subject line\n",
    "4. Do not end the subject line with a period\n",
    "5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line\n",
    "6. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n",
    "7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n",
    "\n",
    "##### .gitignore\n",
    "A `.gitignore` should go in the root of your project and many languages have a default `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a nice default Python starter here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are other language examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/github/gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "Only code that is **documentation**, **configuration** or **custom code** should generally be part of a git repository.\n",
    "\n",
