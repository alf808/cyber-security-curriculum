    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowing How To Ask Questions\n",
    "One of the key traits, specifically for a cybersecurity professional, but even for a career in technology in general, is the ability to have a curious mind. To identify the questions one must ask, and be able to effectively search for answers or solutions. This can manifest itself in learning new tools or concepts, assessing the security posture of an organization, creating new tools, or strategically building a successful career path and find stimulating opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Being The Best Version Of Yourself\n",
    "The goal of your continuing education is focused on your own personal career and outcome, and being the best version of you that you can be, not the best version of someone else. Everyone has their own personal struggles, focus on overcoming your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accountability\n",
    "As a last note, it is also crucial that you realize that you are ultimately responsible for your outcome. There is no secret sauce to success in any career path short of hard work and determination. We cannot force you to put in the extra time outside of class, nor can we force you to make this newly chosen path a daily priority in your life. However, if you can commit \n",
    "to yourself, that is the best chance you have at getting the outcome you desire. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Your Personal Portfolio\n",
    "It is important to remember that the ultimate goal of the DevLeague Cyber Security Professional track is that students achieve a meaningful start to a fulfilling career path as opposed to simply knowing technical subject matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the Cyber Security Professional track will be a focus on helping you build your personal brand and portfolio through the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ongoing Technical Documentation\n",
    "1. Professional Tool Development and/or Contribution\n",
    "1. Online Presence & Outreach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commitment To Ethical Responsibility\n",
    "As part of the DevLeague Cyber Security Professional course, you commit to upholding the highest standards in ethical and responsible behavior. Some of the tools and concepts covered throughout the course can be used for malicious or irresponsible behavior in physical and cyberspace. As a student, you commit to act legally and ethically at all times in and out of the classroom environment, and to not engage in any activities or behavior that would put yourself, your peers, DevLeague or any other party in a compromising or unfavorable position.\n",
