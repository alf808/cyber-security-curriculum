    " - allows a user on a remote client machine, called the client, to access the resource sof another machine the telnet server\n",
    " - It does this by pulling a fast one on the telent server and making the client machine appear as though it were a terminal directy atatched to the local network\n",
    " - Called a software shell - a virtual terminal that can interact wth the chosen remote host\n",
    " - Users begin a telnet session by running the Telent client software and then logging into the telenet server\n",

    "- Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Token Ring \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "UDP \n",
    "- USer Datagram Protocol\n",
    "- Doesnt offer all the bells and whistles of TCP but it is fabulous at transporting information that doesnt require reliable delivery\n",
    "- Like a skinny person on a bench (doesnt take up a lot of room or bandwidth on a network)\n",
    "- We use UDP when when reliability is already handled at the process application layer\n",
    "- Does not sequence the segments and does not care what order the segments arrive in at the destination\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many DoS attacks use UDP\n",
    "    - Send large number of UDP packets to random ports on a remote host\n",
    "    - The victimized system will be forced into sending many ICMP packets, eventually leading it to be unreachable by other clients. \n",
    "    - The attacker(s) may also spoof the IP address of the UDP packets, ensuring that the excessive ICMP return packets do not reach them, and anonymizing their network location(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TCP- Transmission Control Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes large blocks of information from an application and breaks them into segments. \n",

    "- reliable, full-duplex, connection-oriented, accurate, error checking \n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP segments a data stream and prepares it for the Internet Layer, Internet Layer recieves the data stream and routes the segments as packets through an internetwork, Handed to the recieving hosts Host-to-Host layer protocol, which rebuilds the date stream to hand to upper layer prtocols\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creates a session called:\n",
    "\n",
    "Three Way Handshake \n",
    "- Connection Oriented\n",
    "- During the initial handshake, the two TCP processes also agree on the amount of information that will be sent in either direction before recipient sends back an acknowledgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireshark Example\n",
    "- Look for TCP SYN packet\n",
    "- Conversation Filter TCP - Shows just the packets involved in connection\n",
    "- Stream Index- Wireshark assign each TCP connection a stream index starting at 0 -> however many connections in file (Could just filter on this stream using index number)\n",
    "- Sequence Number- 4 byte value in reality that is confusing (Hey mr. server this is the sequence number I am begining with so track everything from now on)\n",
    "- Flags- Syn is the only bit set (SYN true)\n",
    "- Windows size- Size of TCP bytes able to recieve \n",

    "TCP Header \n",
    "- 20 bytes long\n",
    "\n",
    "With everything agreed in advance, the path is paved for reliable communication \n",
    "\n",
    "While the information is being transfered between hosts, the two machines periodically checkin with each other, to make sure everything is going well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three way Handshake\n",
    "SYN First connection agreement is a request for synchronization\n",
    "SYN-ACK Acknowledge the request and establish connection ruless between hosts\n",
    "ACK Final Segment is Acknowledgment and notifies destination host that the connection agreement has been accepted \n",

    "Congestion can occur\n",
    "bottlenecking\n",
    "\n",

    "- The segments delivered are acknowledged back to the sender upon reception\n",
    "- Any segments not acknowledged are retransmitted\n",
    "- Manageable data flow is maintained in order to prevent congestion, overloading and data loss\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If too many packets are sent or they are sent too quickly, the computer stores them in the memory section called buffer. If it keeps flooding the device it will eventually start dropping packets and discarding the additional datagramas that arrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Network flood control systems actually work pretty well \n",
    "The transport can issue a not ready indicator to the sender or source of the flood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A service is considered connection-oriented if:\n",
    "1. Uses a three-way handshake\n",

    "- provide hosts with information about network programs\n",
    "- PING uses ICMP echo request and reply messages to check the physical and logical connectivity of machines on an internetwork\n",
    "- Traceroute uses IP packet Time-To-Live time outs to discover the path a packet takes as it traverses the internetwork\n",
    "- Block ICMP at firewalls and routers which disables a ping response\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ARP\n",
    "- Address Resolution Protocol\n",
    "- Finds the hardware address of a host from a known IP address\n",
    "- When an IP has a datagram to send, it must inform a Network Access Protocol such as ethernet or token ring, of the destinations hardware address on the local network\n",
    "- It has already been informed by upper-layer protocols of the destination's IP address\n",
    "- If the Ip doesnt find the destinations host's hardware address in the ARP cache, it uses ARP to find it\n",
    "- ARP interrogates the local network by sending out a broadcast asking the machine with the specified IP address to reply with its hardware address\n",
    "- So basically ARP translatesthe software IP address into a hardware address \n",
    "- The classic Man-in-the-Middle attack relies on convincing two hosts that the computer in the middle is the other host. This can be accomplished with a domain name spoof if the system is using DNS to identify the other host or address resolution protocol (ARP) spoofing on the LAN. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ports\n",
    "Provide the rules for computers to communicate with each other on a network\n",
    "location where information is sent\n",
    "1. Connectivity- Connecting devices \n",
    "2. Encryption- Data in Transit \n",
    "3. Application- Operate in Application Layer of OSI (Display Information)\n",
    "4. Email- SMTP, POP3, IMAP4\n",
    "TCP/IP- basic connectivity\n",
    "HTTP/SMTP- support specific types of traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- TCP and UDP must use port numbers to communicate with the upper layers becuase they're what keep track of different simultaneous conversations originated by or accepted by the local host\n",
    "- Originating source-Port numbers are dynamically assigned by the source host and will usually have a value of 1024 or higher\n",
    "- Ports 1023 and below are defined in RFC 3232\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a host transmits data accross a network to another device, the data goes through encapsulation\n",
    "- Its wrapped with protocol information at each layer of the OSI model\n",
    "- Each layer communicates only with its peer layer\n",
    "PDU\n",
    "- To communicate and exchange information, each layer uses Protocol Data Units (PDU's)\n",
    "- These hold the control information attached to the data at each layer of the model\n",
    "- They are usually attached to the header in the front of the data field\n",
    "- Each PDU attaches to the data by encapsualting it at each layer of the OSI model\n",
    "- Then its read by the next layer, stripped off and the data is handed to the next level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Works like this...\n",
    "1. User info is converted to data for transmission on the network\n",
    "1. Data is converted to degments, and a reliable connection is set up between transmitting and recieving hosts\n",
    "1. segments are converted to frames for transmission on the local network. \n",
    "1. Hardware (ethernet) addresses are used to uniquely identify hosts on the local network\n",
    "1. Packets or datagrams are converted to bits and a digital encoding and clocking scheme is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets \n",
    "\n",
    "- Packet fields can be modified by attackers for their benefit. \n",
    "- The source and destination IP address or ports are very commonly attacked fields in the denial of service and spoofing attacks, as well as in network penetrations.\n",
    "- Each and every flag and field in a TCP frame and the underlying Ethernet frame can be modified or altered — all for the purpose of network penetration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- packet crafting and packet spoofing  are very different \n",
    "- Spoofing is used by attackers to hide their identities and presence on the network. \n",
    "- Spoofing is primarily used to gain network information such as open ports, running services, active hosts, etc., during which time the target host fails to trace the attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Packet crafting takes a step further by trying to test the presence, functionality or the accuracy of target network’s firewall rules, and intrusion detection systems. \n",
    "- Packet crafting requires in-depth knowledge of TCP packets and how they work, and is more of a manually orchestrated attack than a programmatic one. This makes it a technically advanced way of trying to hack into networks.\n",
