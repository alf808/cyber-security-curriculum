    "    - Document all steps in your Linux Hardening playbook with proper formatting and clear sections\n",
    "    - Perform the following steps in your machine console:\n",
    "        - Create users for everyone on your team, and continue all further operations under your respective user account\n",
    "        - Update your server w/ latest security patches\n",
    "        - Ensure that SSH service is running\n",
    "        - Generate a password-protected SSH key for each user\n",
    "        - Verify you can connect to your guest via SSH from your host machine\n",
    "        - Once verified, start your machine in a headless state and run all futher operations remotely from your host in an SSH terminal\n",
    "        - Add your SSH key to the SSH agent so that you are not asked for your password again for 60 minutes(might not work on Windows)\n",
    "        - Disable root login for SSH\n",

    "        - Install Nginx and write a wrapper bash script that only people in the `webmasters` group only have the ability `restart` the `nginx` service. Place this script in a reasonable location on disk.\n",
    "        - Using the same method allow one member of your team to have the ability to `start` and `stop` the Nginx process. Place this script in a reasonable location on disk.\n",

    "        - Setup remote logging with `rsyslog` on another machine on your network and set your server to write logs to that server via TCP. Why would you use TCP over UDP?\n",
    "        - Setup your remote logging server to only allow logs from the your source machine\n",
    "        - On your remote server, ensure that logs are stored in separate files based on the host they came from\n",
    "        - Setup Two-Factor Authentication with SSH using Google Authenticator. See if you can have a QR code generated when setting up your secret key. NOTE: Make sure you setup your PAM settings properly.\n",
