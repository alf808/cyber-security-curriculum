    "\n",
    "1. Topics/Sub-Topics\n",
    "- Types of Networks\n",
    "About 11 different categories of networks \n",
    "  - PAN\n",
    "      - The smallest and most basic type of network\n",
    "      - PAN is made up of a wireless modem, a computer or two, phones, printers, tablets, etc.\n",
    "      - Revolves around one person in one building. \n",
    "  - LAN's\n",
    "    - A network that provides access to users and end devices in a small geographical area (home, small business)\n",
    "    - High speed bandwidth \n",
    "    - Using a router it connects to WAN's\n",
    "  - WAN's\n",
    "    - Wide Geographical Area like between cities, states, countries or continents\n",
    "    - typically owned and managed by a telecommunications service provider\n",
    "    - Slower speeds\n",
    "    - Administered by multiple service providers\n",
    "    - The Internet is an example of a WAN\n",
    "  - CAN\n",
    "      - Campus Area Network\n",
    "      - Between a LAN and a WAN (bigger than what a LAN supports but doesn't span countries)\n",
    "  - MAN's\n",
    "    - Metropolitan Area Network\n",
    "    - Larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN\n",
    "    - Typically span a city\n",
    "    - The MAN can be used to provide services including telecoms, Internet access, television and CCTV to businesses and citizens in these metropolitan areas.\n",
    "  - SAN \n",
    "    - Storage Area Network \n",
    "    - a high-speed network of storage devices that also connects those storage devices with servers\n",
    "    - Can be accessed by applications on networked servers\n",
    "    - Virtual SAN: \n",
    "        - Virtual SAN is a software-defined storage offering from VMware \n",
    "        - Enables enterprises to pool their storage capabilities and to instantly and automatically provision virtual machine storage via simple policies that are driven by the virtual machine.\n",
    "  - WLAN's\n",
    "    - Wirelessly interconnects users and and points in a small geographical environment\n",
    "    - Every component that connects to a WLAN is considered a station and falls into one of two categories: access points (APs) and clients.\n",
    "    - Uses high-frequency radio waves and often include an access point to the Internet\n",
    "  - VPN's\n",
    "      - Virtual Private Network\n",
    "      - Makes your local host part of the remote network by using the WAN link that connects you to the remote LAN\n",
    "      - The VPN will make your host appear as though its local on the remote network\n",
    "    - My home network  in Hawaii but I want it to appear on my corporate office in Colorado so I can get to my remote servers \n",
    "    - A VPN allows me to connect to these resources by locally attaching to the VLAN through a VPN across the WAN\n",
    "     - By extending a private network across the Internet, a VPN lets its users send and receive data as if their devices were connected to the private network – even if they’re not. \n",
    "      - uses virtual point-to-point connection, users can access a private network remotely.\n",
    "      Computer uses on LAN, connects to a different remote LAN, and uses its resources remotely.\n",
    "  - VLAN's\n",
    "      - Virtual Local Area Network\n",
    "      - Similar to a LAN except that it is built logically\n",
    "      - In a VLAN your host still resides in a network, but where you are physically connected is not important\n",
    "    - Matters which port you are physically connected to and you configure on a switch \n",
    "    - VLANS are new workgroups and define a group of users sharing network resources\n",
    "    - VLANS allow you to be anywhere on the physical network and still be local to the specific network resources you need\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Connection Options\n",
    "  - Dedicated Leased Line\n",
    "    - reserved circuits within service providers network that connect geographically separated offices for private voice and/or data networking \n",
    "  - Ethernet WAN\n",
    "    - Extend LAN access technology into the WAN \n",
    "  - 4 Things networks need: Fault Tolerance, Scalability, Quality of Service, Security \n",
    " \n",
    "- Topologies\n",
    "    - Network Topology refers to the layout of a network and how different nodes in a network are connected to each other and how they communicate.\n",
    "    - Physically how devices are conencted or Logical representation of how data is transmitted\n",
    "  - Network Topologies\n",
    "    - Bus (Most Common)\n",
    "        - a network setup in which each computer and network device are connected to a single cable\n",
    "        - Not great for large networks\n",
    "        - less cable \n",
    "        - Hard to troubleshoot because everything is on same line\n",
    "        - Can be slow\n",
    "    - Star\n",
    "        - A star topology consists of a central connection hub to which devices are connected with UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair) Ethernet.\n",
    "        - Uses Point-to-Point connection\n",
    "        - Easy to maintain \n",
    "        - Easy to diagnose a problem\n",
    "        - Not very scalable\n",
    "        - Dependent on Hub/switch\n",
    "        - Network connectin may be slow\n",
    "    - Ring \n",
    "        - All the nodes are connected to each-other to make a closed loop. \n",
    "        - Each workstation is connected to two other components on either side, and it communicates with these two adjacent neighbors.\n",
    "        -  Network traffic was never collided and the entire topology did not require additional devices\n",
    "        - Scalable\n",
    "        - As soon as the very first computer of ring topology was powered on, it used to generate a token which used to circulate in the entire network. \n",
    "        - The token used to travel in the entire circle and was received and released by every computer that was connected.\n",
    "        - If one computer goes down the whole network cant function\n",
    "        - Doesnt need network devices to communicate\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mesh\n",
    "        - Every node is connected to every other node in the network\n",
    "        - Expensive \n",
    "        - Data can be transmitted from different devices simultaneously. \n",
    "        - This topology can withstand high traffic.\n",
    "        - Even if one of the components fails there is always an alternative present. So data transfer doesn’t get affected.\n",
    "        - Scales well\n",
    "     - Tree and Hybrid Topologies\n",
    "         - Combine different types of topologies\n",
    "     - Hub and Spoke\n",
    "         - Used in VPN \n",
    "         \n",
    "- Two main network types \n",
    "    - Peer-to-Peer:\n",
    "        - two or more PCs are connected and share resources without going through a separate server computer\n",
    "        - Workstation sharing\n",
    "        - No centralized server\n",
    "        - All computers connected are equal\n",
    "        - EX:  If User A's PC is connected to a printer that User B wants to access, User A must set his machine to allow (share) access to the printer. Similarly, if User B wants to have access to a folder or file, or even a complete hard drive, on User A's PC, User A must enable file sharing on his PC.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Client Server:\n",
    "    - A computer network is referred to as client/server if (at least) one of the computers is used to \"serve\" other computers referred to as \"clients\". \n",
    "    - Clients are computers with software installed that enable them to request and display the information obtained from the server\n",
    "     - Servers are computers with software that enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. Each service requires separate server software.\n",
    "     - Servers are generally not used by humans directly, but rather run continuously to provide \"services\" to the other computers (and their human users) on the network\n",
    "     \n",
    "    \n",
    "- OSI Model (See OSI Module)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cables and Connections\n",
    "  - Coaxial, copper cat5, fiber, wireless, serial, Console Cables \n",
    "  - Crossover vs. Straight-through\n",
    "      - Straight-Through \n",
    "          - wired cat5e cable is used to connect computers, printers and other network client devices to the router switch or hub (the host device in this instance).\n",
    "      - Crossover cables \n",
    "          - Most commonly used to connect two hosts directly. Examples would be connecting a computer directly to another computer, connecting a switch directly to another switch, or connecting a router to a router\n",
    "         - Now days most devices have auto sensing technology that detects the cable and device and crosses pairs when needed.\n",
    "         \n",
    "  - How to make cables \n",
    "  - Transmission speeds, duplex, distance, noise (pg. 75)\n",
