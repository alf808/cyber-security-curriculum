    "# Intro To Netcat\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "- TCP/IP knowledge\n",
    "- Basics of Networking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Topics/Sub-Topics\n",
    "** Run all demos in Kali if possible **\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is netcat?\n",
    "Netcat is known as the *Swiss Army Knife of networking*. It is a native Unix utility and at it's core a TCP/UDP tool and hence it's place in the networking tools ecosystem. It can create almost any kind of network connection that you would need in a modern network.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why netcat?\n",
    "Netcat is installed on most Linux distributions by default. Along with it's flexibility, it's a tool that is commonly known to be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netcat is commonly flagged on Windows anit-virus products as malware and quarantined. In those cases telnet can serve as a similar connection testing tool between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### netcat Basics\n",
    "Netcat essentially does **two things** very well:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Transfer Data\n",
    "2. Listen for Requests on a Port\n",
    "\n",
    "** Flags **\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-l` - Listen on port\n",
    "- `-v` - Verbose output, good habit to use on most use cases since default feedback is minimal\n",
    "- `-p` - Port to listen on\n",
    "- `-e` - Execute command on connection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What can netcat do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Used in scripts to automate tasks\n",
    "- Copy a file between two systems with not FTP or SSH:\n",
    "- Clone a hard drive or partition\n",
    "- Port scanning\n",
    "- Pass or recieve a shell to/from another machine\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Copy Files Between Servers\n",
    "    - Server: `nc -lp 1234 > some-file.tar.gz`\n",
    "    - Client: `nc -w 1 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 1234 < some-file.tar.gz`\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Clone Hard Drive or Partition\n",
    "**Standard usage example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`dd if=SomePreviousImage.iso of=/dev/sda`\n",
    "\n",
    "**With netcat:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start the listener on the new system receiving the image:\n",
    "    - Clone Server: `nc -l -p 1234 | dd of=/dev/sda`\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Start the `dd` utility on the original server and pipe stdout to the connection on listening connection:\n",
    "    - Original Server: `dd if=/dev/sda | nc 192.168.0.12 1234`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Port Scanning\n",
    "- Check for a single port: `nc -v 192.168.1.24 80`\n",
    "    - What kind of connection is this?\n",
    "- Check remote server for a range of ports: `nc -v -w 1 192.168.1.24 -z 1-1000`\n",
    "- Check local server for open ports: `nc -v -w 1 localhost -z 1-1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Execute Shell on Established Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Act as a web simple server\n",
    "Netcat can start listening on a given port and pipe the contents of a file over the connection whenever a connection is established:\n",
    "\n",
    "`while true; do nc -l -p 80 -q 1 < index.html; done`\n",
    "`while true; do nc -l -p 80 -q 1 < payload.tar.gz; done`\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Spoof HTTP Headers/Request Web Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Act As Chat Server\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Auto-closing SSH tunnel\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reverse Shells\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Push Command Shell To Listener\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Pre-requisites\n",

    "- https://www.sans.org/security-resources/sec560/netcat_cheat_sheet_v1.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Challenges/Exercises\n",
    "- Setup a backdoor on a system and use Nmap to discover\n",
    "- Install fail2ban and scan that host and see how you can configure to get even stealthier requests to jail\n",
    "- Look at firewall logs for the scans you are creating and see what makes it's way to the logs and what doesn't\n",
