    "# Wireless Networks - Hacking WPA2 Wireless\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Topics/Sub-Topics\n",
    "    - How to capture traffic on a wireless network\n",
    "    - How to put a NIC/Wireless card in monitor/promiscous mode\n",
    "    - How to scan for available wireless networks\n",
    "        - `iwlist wlan0 scan` (older method)\n",
    "        - `iw dev wlan0 scan` (newer utility, more info)\n",
    "        - Take note of relevant information needing for attacking target\n",
    "            - MAC Address\n",
    "            - Channel\n",
    "            - Frequency\n",
    "            - Encryption on/off\n",
    "            - ESSID\n",
    "    - How to put your wireless card into monitor mode\n",
    "        - Run `airmon-ng check`\n",
    "            - Look at output to see if any running process may conflict with `airmon-ng`\n",
    "            - Option: Some cards have no problem, but to be sure you can kill all processes that may intefere with `airmon-ng check kill`\n",
    "        - Run `airmon-ng start wlan0`\n",
    "        - Card should now be in monitor mode with output showing that it created a wireless interface called `mon0`\n",
    "            - NOTE: To return to Managed mode at any time run `airmon-ng stop wlan0mon`. You may need to do this two times. Running `iwconfig` should show the `wlan0` interface again. May also need to run `service network-manager restart`\n",
    "        - Run `iwconfig`\n",
    "            - Should see new `wlan0mon` interface with `Mode: Monitor`\n",
    "        - Run `airodump-ng mon0 --channel 6`\n",
    "            - You will see all wireless networks in range broadcasting on channel 6 and information about them including\n",
    "                - BSSID (MAC Address)\n",
    "                - Encryption algorithm used\n",
    "                - ESSID (Station Name)\n",
    "                - MAC address of connected clients\n",
    "\n",
