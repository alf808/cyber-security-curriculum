    "1.\tThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has mandated that all IT systems with credit card data be segregated from the main corporate network to prevent unauthorized access and that access to the IT systems should be logged. Which of the following would BEST meet the CISO’s requirements?\n",

    "3. Joe, the Chief Technical Officer (CTO), is concerned about new malware being introduced into the corporate network. He has tasked the security engineers to implement a technology that is capable of alerting the team when unusual traffic is on the network. Which of the following types of technologies will BEST address this scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Application Firewall \n",
    "B. Anomaly Based IDS \n",
    "C. Proxy Firewall \n",
    "D. Signature IDS \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: B Explanation:  Anomaly-based detection watches the ongoing activity in the environment and looks for abnormal occurrences. An anomaly-based monitoring or detection method relies on definitions of all valid forms of activity. This database of known valid activity allows the tool to detect any and all anomalies. Anomaly-based detection is commonly used for protocols. Because all the valid and legal forms of a protocol are known and can be defined, any variations from those known valid constructions are seen as anomalies. \n",

    "4. Matt, an administrator, notices a flood fragmented packet and retransmits from an email server. After disabling the TCP offload setting on the NIC, Matt sees normal traffic with packets flowing in sequence again. Which of the following utilities was he MOST likely using to view this issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Spam filter  \n",
    "B. Protocol analyzer \n",
    "C. Web application firewall \n",
    "D. Load balancer \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: B Explanation:  A protocol analyzer is a tool used to examine the contents of network traffic. Commonly known as a sniffer, a protocol analyzer can be a dedicated hardware device or software installed onto a typical host system. In either case, a protocol analyzer is first a packet capturing tool that can collect network traffic and store it in memory or onto a storage device. Once a packet is captured, it can be analyzed either with complex automated tools and scripts or manually.\n",

    "5. Which the following flags are used to establish a TCP connection? (Select TWO).\n",
    "\n",
    "A. PSH \n",
    "B. ACK \n",
    "C. SYN \n",
    "D. URG \n",
    "E. FIN \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: B,C Explanation:  To establish a TCP connection, the three-way (or 3-step) handshake occurs: SYN: The active open is performed by the client sending a SYN to the server. The client sets the segment's sequence number to a random value A. SYN-ACK: In response, the server replies with a SYN-ACK. The acknowledgment number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. A+1, and the sequence number that the server chooses for the packet is another random number, B. ACK: Finally, the client sends an ACK back to the server. The sequence number is set to the received acknowledgement value i.e. A+1, and the acknowledgement number is set to one more than the received sequence number i.e. B+1. \n",

    "A. Firewall \n",
    "B. Switch \n",
    "C. URL content filter \n",
    "D. Spam filter \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: C Explanation:  URL filtering, also known as web filtering, is the act of blocking access to a site based on all or part of the URL used to request access. URL filtering can focus on all or part of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), specific path names, specific filenames, specific fi le extensions, or entire specific URLs. Many URL-filtering tools can obtain updated master URL block lists from vendors as well as allow administrators to add or remove URLs from a custom list.\n",

    "\n",
    "POST: /payload.php HTTP/1.1\n",

    "C. Network-based Intrusion Detection System \n",
    "D. Stateful Inspection Firewall \n",
    "E. URL Content Filter \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: B Explanation:  A web application firewall is a device, server add-on, virtual service, or system filter that defines a strict set of communication rules for a website and all visitors. It’s intended to be an application specific firewall to prevent cross-site scripting, SQL injection, and other web application attacks.\n",

    "8. The security administrator needs to manage traffic on a layer 3 device to support FTP from a new remote site. Which of the following would need to be implemented?\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Implicit deny \n",
    "B. VLAN management \n",
    "C. Port security \n",
    "D. Access control lists \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: D Explanation:  In the OSI model, IP addressing and IP routing are performed at layer 3 (the network layer). In this question we need to configure routing. When configuring routing, you specify which IP range (in this case, the IP subnet of the remote site) is allowed to route traffic through the router to the FTP server. \n",
    " \n",
    "Traffic that comes into the router is compared to ACL entries based on the order that the entries occur in the router. New statements are added to the end of the list. The router continues to look until it has a match. If no matches are found when the router reaches the end of the list, the traffic is denied. For this reason, you should have the frequently hit entries at the top of the list. There is an implied deny for traffic that is not permitted.\n",

    "D. Proxies \n",
    "E. Firewall \n",
    "F. NIDS \n",
    "G. URL filtering \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: D,E,G Explanation:  A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. Firewalls manage traffic using a rule or a set of rules. A URL is a reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource. A URL filter is used to block access to a site based on all or part of a URL. \n",

    "C. Network separation \n",
    "D. 802.1x \n",
    "Answer: D Explanation:  802.1x is a port-based authentication mechanism. It’s based on Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and is commonly used in closed-environment wireless networks. 802.1x was initially used to compensate for the weaknesses of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), but today it’s often used as a component in more complex authentication and connection-management systems, including Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), Diameter, Cisco System’s Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+), and Network Access Control (NAC).\n",

    " \n",
    "A virtual local area network (VLAN) is a hardware-imposed network segmentation created by switches. By default, all ports on a switch are part of VLAN 1. But as the switch administrator changes the VLAN assignment on a port-by-port basis, various ports can be grouped together and be distinct from other VLAN port designations. VLANs are used for traffic management. Communications between ports within the same VLAN occur without hindrance, but communications between VLANs require a routing function\n",
    "\n",
    "13. A Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is tasked with outsourcing the analysis of security logs.

    "A. SaaS \n",
    "B. MaaS \n",
    "C. IaaS \n",
    "D. PaaS \n",
    "Answer: B Explanation:  Monitoring-as-a-service (MaaS) is a cloud delivery model that falls under anything as a service (XaaS). MaaS allows for the deployment of monitoring functionalities for several other services and applications within the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Joe, a security administrator, believes that a network breach has occurred in the datacenter as a result of a misconfigured router access list, allowing outside access to an SSH server. Which of the following should Joe search for in the log files?\n",

    "B. Network ping sweeps \n",
    "C. Host port scans \n",
    "D. Connections to port 22 \n",
    " \n",
    "Answer: D Explanation:  Log analysis is the art and science of reviewing audit trails, log files, or other forms of computer generated records for evidence of policy violations, malicious events, downtimes, bottlenecks, or other issues of concern. SSH uses TCP port 22. All protocols encrypted by SSH also use TCP port 22, such as SFTP, SHTTP, SCP, SExec, and slogin. \n",

    "C. Load balancer \n",
    "D. Proxy \n",

    "C. The router filters port 80 traffic. \n",
    "D. The router implements NAT. \n",
    "Answer: D Explanation:  Network address translation (NAT) allows you to share a connection to the public Internet via a single interface with a single public IP address. NAT maps the private addresses to the public address. In a typical configuration, a local network uses one of the designated \"private\" IP address subnets. A router on that network has a private address (192.168.1.1) in that address space, and is also connected to the Internet with a \"public\" address (10.2.2.1) assigned by an Internet service provider.\n",
