    "# Hardware & Operating Systems - Power Supplies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Topics/Sub-Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- The power supply takes electricity from the wall socket and transforms it into electricity to run computer\n",
    "- Electricity\n",
    "    - flow of negatively charged electrons through matter\n",
    "    - Similar to water flowing\n",
    "    - voltage- pressure of electrons(volts)\n",
    "    - Current- amount of electrons moving past a certain point on a wire (amps)\n",
    "    - Wattage- amount of amps and volts needed so that a device will function (watts)\n",
    "    - Resistance- resistance to flow of electrons (ohms)\n",
    "    - V x A = W\n",
    "- Electricity comes in 2 flavors: \n",
    "    1. Direct Current (DC)- electrons flow in one direction around a continuous circuit\n",
    "    1. Alternating Current (AC)- electron alternate direction back and forth in a circuit\n",
    "- Most electronic devices use DC power but all power companies supply AC because i travels long distances more efficiently\n",
    "- AC comes in somewhere between 110 and 120 \n",
    "- Power supply connects to the power cord via IEC-320 connector\n",
    "- Multimeter- Used to test power to outlets and devices \n",
    "- Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)- protects your computer (and data!) in the event of a power sag or power outage\n",
    "- What do you need to consider when getting the right UPS?\n",
    "    - You need to calculate how much wattage your computer, monitor, drives, etc require in order to get a proper UPS\n",
    "    - How long do you want/need power supply to run when you lose power?\n",
    "    - [Wattage Calculator](http://www.coolermaster.com/power-supply-calculator/)\n",
    "- Motherboards use a 20- or 24-pin P1 power connector\n",
    "- SATA Power Connectors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Pre-requisites\n",
    "- A+ Chapter 3, Chapter 7 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Desired Outcomes\n",
    "- Students should understand that problems with power can create system instability crashes and data loss\n",
    "- Students should know basic principles of electricity \n",
    "- Students should know how to recognize power problems and how to solve them\n",
    "- **Students should know that a power supply is also referred to a PSU and also falls into the category of field replaceable unit**\n",
    "- **Students should know that an electrical outlet must have a ground wire to be suitable**\n",
    "- **Students should be familiar with power supply dual voltage**\n",
    "- Students should know what a multimeter is and how to use it (pg. 277)\n",
    "- **Students should be familiar with the technology and use of surge suppressors and battery backup systems (UPS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Students can define the main function of a CPU\n",
    "- Students understand the concept of binary modes and switches\n",
    "- Students know that instructions are sent to the CPU via the External Data Bus(EDB)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Resources\n",
    "- [A+ Ninth Edition Study Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sBO4JPU8b43FzC03mTctugJc-ICHLZlP/view?usp=sharing)\n",
    "- [A+ 220-901 Exam Study Objectives](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFbvLvM9XoxiZZ73R3ExIgFlUzn_dKvx)\n",
    "- [CPU-Z Tool](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Challenges/Exercises\n",
    "- Lecture: High level explanation of electricity and how a power supply converts AC to DC. \n",
    "- Activity: Use a Multimeter to test outlets and devices\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Self Study Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read CompTIA A+ - Chapter 4\n",
    "- Take Chapter 4 exam tests\n",
    "- Build out personal question list\n",
    "- Groom individual student backlog\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Estimated Time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Applicable Standards\n",
    "If there are any publicly available standards that can be mapped to this module they should be identified here.\n",
    "    - NIST ???\n"
