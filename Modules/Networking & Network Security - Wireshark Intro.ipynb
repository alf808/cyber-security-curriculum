    "            - In computer networking, promiscuous mode is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that causes the controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU) rather than passing only the frames that the controller is specifically programmed to receive.\n",

    "        - Ways to cut down the number of requests:\n",
    "            - Specify ports to scan rather than default 1000\n",
    "                - target an individual ports will only send 2 packets on default scan\n",
    "                    - `nmap 192.168.1.4 -p 80`\n",
    "                - nmap -Pn scan to a single port will only send 1 request\n",
    "                    - `nmap 192.168.1.4 -p 80 -Pn`\n",
    "                - nmap -Pn scan with a few ports to reduce request number\n",
