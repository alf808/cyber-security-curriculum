    "#### 2. Pre-requisites\n",
    "- Basic Linux knowledge\n",
    "- Basic networking knowledge of types of protocols and common ports\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Desired Outcomes\n",
    "- Students should understand the basic purpose of firewalls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Resources\n",
    "- https://danielmiessler.com/study/iptables/\n",
    "- https://danielmiessler.com/blog/professional-firewall-iptables/\n",
    "- https://www.netfilter.org/\n",
    "- https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ufw-essentials-common-firewall-rules-and-commands\n",
    "- http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man8/ufw.8.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Challenges/Exercises\n",
    "- Create a script to setup a basic web server, including the ability to remotely access the server and check on it's basic health\n",
    "- Create a script to setup a basic DNS server, including the ability to remotely access the server and check on it's basic health\n",
    "- Set up a local private interface and NAT traffic to that internal port\n",
    "- Install `fail2ban` and direct traffic to the site and inspect change in firewall rules\n",
    "- Write a `fail2ban` mini clone\n",
    "```\n",
    "fail2ban is, as you say, essentially just a script that does regex on log files, extracts malicious sources from those logs (e.g. failed SSH login, web client triggering repeated 4xx or 5xx respones, or having a user-agent associated with known attacker profiles). It integrates with iptables (and whatever might be running on top of iptables, e.g. firewalld, shorewall), in order to block traffic related to malicious hosts. Those blocks tend to be implemented either as simple iptables rules, or as an iptables rule + an ipset.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Self Study Objectives\n",
    "- Read both Daniel Miessler links in and out\n",
    "- Make sure any servers you run are setup with good policy\n",
